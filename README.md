# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User needs are interpreted, as the person who is requesting them plus their need plus why they need it (persona + need + purpose). The format of the user stories envelope the requirements, for a specific program function, from the user's perspective. User stories also ensure that all the user needs and requirements are short, clear, and concise. That way, they will be easily understood by the development team. 
# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach developing programs from a standpoint that is relative to the development team and client needs. Every group and their needs differ so, the approaches used in the development process depends on the needs of the people that will be using them. The agile practices that I hope to incorporate into my future development are Kanban, Scrum, and Lean-Software Development. 
# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To be a good team member in software development, one must possess effective communication, problem-solving, and team-building skills. They should have qualities that reflect responsibility, reliability, and flexibility. These combined characteristics create a well-rounded, team-oriented software development team member.
